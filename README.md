### Abstract:

Single-cell transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) represents the most innovative technology for examining genome-wide regulatory landscapes in single cells. For this tutorial, we will be analyzing a single-cell ATAC-seq dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) provided by 10x Genomics. We will run bridge integration for PBMC with the newly released Azimuth ATAC workflow. In this workshop we will review the existing statistical tools for analyzing scATAC-seq data, how to document your analysis and review some tools for interpreting results.

### Learning objectives:

1.   Fundamentals of Single Cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and Multiome analysis.
2.   Single-Cell ATAC-seq Pre-Processing and Quality Control.
3.   Loading in and pre-processing the scATAC-seq, multiome, and scRNA-seq reference datasets.
4. Mapping the scATAC-seq dataset via bridge integration.
5. Exploring and assessing the resulting annotations.
6. Motif analysis with Signac
