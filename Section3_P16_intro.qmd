# **Practical 16:** Motif analysis with Signac {#install .setup style="blue"}

In this step, we will demonstrate the following:

-   Identifying enriched motifs.
-   Obtaining motif activity scores.

# **Motif analysis**

The previous analysis (**Practical 14 - Find differentially accessible peaks between cell types**, `da_peaks`) can help us to identify putative *cis*-regulatory elements that are critical for regulating cell type identity or cell state transitions. This is usually achieved via the binding of certain *trans*-regulators, e.g. TFs, to those open chromatin regions.

The binding of most TFs have strong sequence specificity, which can be summarized into sequence motifs, i.e. the TF binding motifs. If certain TFs play important roles in those regulations, it is very likely that the cell-type-specific peaks are regions enriched for the binding, with their genomic sequences enriched for the corresponding TF binding motifs. In this case, by checking the motifs enriched in those cell-type-specific peaks, we may be then able to identify TFs responsible for establishment and maintanence of cell type identity.

To do that, we also need a database of TF binding motifs. Indeed, there are several commonly used databases, including the commercial ones like [TRANSFAC](https://genexplain.com/transfac/) and open source ones like [JASPAR](https://jaspar.genereg.net/). By scanning for sequences matching those motifs, we can predict possible binding sites of the TFs with binding motif information in the databases, and then check their enrichment in the peak list of interest in relative to the other peaks.

### The `Motif` Class

The `Motif` class stores information needed for DNA sequence motif analysis, and has the following slots:

-   `data`: a sparse feature by motif matrix, where entries are 1 if the feature contains the motif, and 0 otherwise

-   `pwm`: A named list of position weight or position frequency matrices

-   `motif.names`: a list of motif IDs and their common names

-   `positions`: A `GRangesList` object containing the exact positions of each motif

-   `meta.data`: Additional information about the motifs

Many of these slots are optional and do not need to be filled, but are only required when running certain functions. For example, the `positions` slot will be needed if running TF footprinting. For more details on the [**Motif** class](https://stuartlab.org/signac/articles/data_structures#the-motif-class).

### Step 1: Adding motif information to the Seurat object

To add the DNA sequence motif information required for motif analyses, we can run the [`AddMotifs()`](https://stuartlab.org/signac/reference/addmotifs) function:

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Signac)
library(Seurat)
# BiocManager::install("JASPAR2020")
library(JASPAR2020) # Data package for JASPAR database (version 2020)
# BiocManager::install("TFBSTools")
library(TFBSTools) # Software Package for Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) Analysis
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38)
library(patchwork)
# BiocManager::install("motifmatchr")
library(motifmatchr)
library(GenomicRanges)
# BiocManager::install("ggseqlogo")
library(ggseqlogo)
```

```{r load data}
# load from Section 2 P14 - STEP: Find differentially accessible peaks between cell types, da_peaks
load(file = "data/pbmc.RData") # from Practical 13
# load(file = "data/pbmc_edited.RData")
# Idents(pbmc) <- pbmc$predicted.id
p1 <- DimPlot(pbmc, label = TRUE, pt.size = 0.1) + NoLegend()
p1
```

```{r add info, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of motif position frequency matrices from the JASPAR database
pfm <- getMatrixSet(
    x = JASPAR2020,
    opts = list(species = "Homo sapiens", all_versions = FALSE)
)

# add motif information
pbmc <- AddMotifs(
  object = pbmc,
  genome = BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38,
  pfm = pfm
)
```

To facilitate motif analysis in Signac, we have created the `Motif` class to store all the required information, including a list of position weight matrices (PWMs) or position frequency matrices (PFMs) and a motif occurrence matrix. Here, the [`AddMotifs()`](https://stuartlab.org/signac/reference/addmotifs) function constructs a `Motif` object and adds it to our mouse brain dataset, along with other information such as the base composition of each peak. A motif object can be added to any Seurat assay using the [`SetAssayData()`](https://mojaveazure.github.io/seurat-object/reference/AssayData.html) function. See the [object interaction vignette](https://stuartlab.org/signac/articles/data_structures) for more information.

Cluster composition shows many clusters unique to the whole blood dataset:

```{r count table}
count_table <- table(pbmc@meta.data$seurat_clusters, pbmc@meta.data$orig.ident)
count_table
```

### Step 2: **Identifying enriched motifs /** Finding overrepresented motifs

To identify potentially important cell-type-specific regulatory sequences, we can search for DNA motifs that are overrepresented in a set of peaks that are differentially accessible between cell types.

Here, we find differentially accessible peaks between Pvalb and Sst inhibitory interneurons. For sparse data (such as scATAC-seq), we find it is often necessary to lower the `min.pct` threshold in [`FindMarkers()`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/FindMarkers.html) from the default (0.1, which was designed for scRNA-seq data).

We then perform a **hypergeometric test to test the probability of observing the motif** at the given frequency by chance, comparing with a background set of peaks matched for GC content.

```{r FindMarkers, eval=FALSE}
# Find differentially accessible peaks in cluster 0 compared to cluster 1 (~1h 7m)
da_peaks <- FindMarkers(
    object = pbmc,
    #ident.1 = 'CD14+ Monocytes',
    #ident.2 = 'pre-B cell',
    ident.1 = '0',
    ident.2 = '1',
    only.pos = TRUE,
    min.pct = 0.05,
    test.use = 'LR',
    latent.vars = 'nCount_peaks'
)
```

```{r top peaks,,eval=FALSE}
# Get the top differentially accessible peaks, with lowest p-values
top.da.peak <- rownames(da_peaks[da_peaks$p_val < 0.005 & da_peaks$pct.1 > 0.2, ])
```

```{r save, eval=FALSE}
# save
save(da_peaks, file = "data/pbmc_markers.RData")
# save information
save(pbmc, top.da.peak, file = "data/pbmc_motifs.RData")
```

```{r enriched motifs}
load(file = "data/pbmc_motifs.RData")
# Find motifs enriched in these top differentially accessible peaks
enriched.motifs <- FindMotifs(
    object = pbmc,
    features = top.da.peak
)
head(enriched.motifs)
```

```{r graph motifs}
MotifPlot(
  object = pbmc,
  motifs = head(rownames(enriched.motifs))
)
```

### **Step 3: Motif activity scores**

We can also compute a per-cell motif activity score by running [chromVAR](https://greenleaflab.github.io/chromVAR/index.html). The motif activity score for a motif M is based on the number of reads mapping to peaks with motif M, after normalization correction for various biases: GC content, average number of reads mapping across all cells etc. You can read more about chromVar [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4401). Motif activity scores allow us to visualize motif activities per cell.

::: callout-note
ChromVAR identifies motifs associated with variability in chromatin accessibility between cells. See the chromVAR [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4401) for a complete description of the method.
:::

It is also possible to directly test for differential activity scores between cell types, without looking at peaks with differential binding. This tends to give similar results as performing an enrichment test on differentially accessible peaks between the cell types (shown above).

::: callout-caution
This takes a while to run (around 5 minutes on Uppmax).
:::

```{r load packages}
# BiocManager::install("chromVAR")
library(chromVAR)
```

```{r chromvar, eval=FALSE}
# Use chromVAR to calculate the motif activities of all motifs in all cells.
chromvar_pbmc <- RunChromVAR(
    object = pbmc,
    genome = BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38,
    verbose = TRUE
)

DefaultAssay(chromvar_pbmc) <- 'chromvar'

# Look at results
pbmc$chromvar
GetAssayData(pbmc$chromvar)[1:10,1:3]
```

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# Have a look at the activitiy of the FOS motif, which has id MA0476.1
DefaultAssay(pbmc) <- 'chromvar'
FeaturePlot(
    object = pbmc,
    features = "MA0476.1",
    min.cutoff = 'q10',
    max.cutoff = 'q90',
    pt.size = 0.1
)
p1 + p2
```

We can also directly test for differential activity scores between cell types. This tends to give similar results as performing an enrichment test on differentially accessible peaks between the cell types (shown above).

When performing differential testing on the chromVAR z-score, we can set `mean.fxn=rowMeans` and `fc.name="avg_diff"` in the [`FindMarkers()`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/FindMarkers.html) function so that the fold-change calculation computes the average difference in z-score between the groups.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Look for motifs that have differential activity between clusters 0 and 1.
differential.activity <- FindMarkers(
    object = pbmc,
    ident.1 = '0',
    ident.2 = '1',
    only.pos = TRUE,
    test.use = 'LR',
    min.pct = 0.2,
    latent.vars = 'nCount_peaks'
)

MotifPlot(
    object = pbmc,
    motifs = head(rownames(differential.activity)),
    assay = 'peaks'
)
```
